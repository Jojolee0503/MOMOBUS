<h2> <span class="line" style="font-family: Tohoma; font-size: 120%;"> Teemo Murciélago Agiu Gucci Lee </span> </h2>
	<p> Also known as the Food Chomper or Teemo, is a 2 years old male miniature poodle.
	
</p><h3 class="bold"> Teemo's Orgin </h3>
	<p> On a snowy day on February 25, 2019, a <strong class="yellow"> <a <em=""> 
	
	star  🌟 </a>  </strong> 
	was born. The second this majestic animal was born the sky stopped snowing <br> 
	the gloomy sky faded away and a gleam of sunlight shined direct at this newborn baby dog.
	Different from his siblings  <br>
	when Teemo was pushed out of his mother's womb he was not pink, slimy and ugly but instead he comes out  
	<br>glowing in warm yellow-orange light and in a body of the rich luscious brown coat, a pair of beady eyes and splendid body size and dimension. <br> He was perfect in all sorts of ways.	  
	(Legend said that the light emitting from Teemo was so strong that the nurse who was in charge of the operation was blinded. )  <br>
	Shortly after, Teemo stood up and let out his first woof and it was at that moment the world stops everything they were doing and listen to 
	his harmonic <br>chime-like bark.  And there is the orgin of Teemo Murciélago Agiu Gucci Lee.
